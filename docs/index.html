<h1 align="left">Abstract</h1>
<p>
Gun N' Penguin is a zombie survival shooter game made in in Unity3d. We demonstrate the use of fractals
in generating explosions for enemy death animations, build a 3D sound perspective system,
and highlight a multitude of physical simulations. We discuss some of the difficulties we faced
during our project development.
</p>

<h1 align ="left">Animations</h1>

<h2 align = "left">Explosion Generation</h2>
<p>
  One of the main graphics component of our project is the explosions that happen when enemies are killed.
  Instead of using Unity’s particle system, we decided to try using C# scripted fractals to generate our explosion visuals.
  To get started, we followed a tutorial on how to use recursion to generate basic fractals from the
  VR@Berkeley. Our script takes in a geometric shape and recursively spawns children
  in 5 orthogonal directions (ie. 3D cartesian coordinate axes minus 1) to create a fractal.
  After an infinite number of recursions, the shape that the fractal fills would be that of
  pyramid.
</p>

<div align="middle">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="./images/frac1.png"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Fractal's overall geometry after depth=5 recursions. This is a top-down view. </figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>
  In order to create a more spherical result, we used the triangular faces of the
  pyramid that the recursive step forms and calculated the centroid of each triangle to generate
  4 new directions from the parent position. Now, each recursive step generates 9 children that are
  spread out more evenly in a hemispheric shape. We end up using depth=4 for the
  final animation clip, and also omit the additional 4 directions at depths 1 and 3.
  In total, each explosion animation generates a total of
  $$1+(1\cdot 6)+(6 \cdot 9)+(54 \cdot 5)+(270 \cdot 9) = 2761 \text{ objects}$$
</p>
<p>
    When applying color to these explosions, we used a transparent texture with a orange tint.
    The explosion ends up looking brighter at the center because many objects overlap there while
    at the edges of the fractal, the color starts to shift to a more orange tint.
</p>

<div align="middle">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="./images/frac3.png"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">A fully-expanded explosion.</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>
  In order for the animation to expand and contract like a real explosion, we
  vary the expiration timers for each recursion layer.
  The first layers exist for 1 second, and each layer lasts shorter and shorter until it hits 0.1 second at depth = 4.
</p>
<p>
  In order for the explosion to illuminate its surroundings, we made point lights
  appear at the center of the first depth layer of shapes.
  Finally, we scaled the explosion’s size to match the size of the enemy and also added a burst of smoke
  using Unity’s particle system. We also add some randomization to the size of the children so that each explosion
  has some variation. We also used different base meshes to create different shapes shown below.
</p>

<h2 align = "left"> Penguin animations </h2>
We created the death animation for our penguin player. We make the penguin model
writhe in place by rotating its body, dictating the parameters in keyframes of the animation.
We then let unity's built-in tweening program interpolate the animations in between the key frames.
After creating the animation, we string together an animation state machine to determine when to transition
from one animation to the other.

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="./images/animation.png" />
        <figcaption align="middle">This is the animation window with keyframes specifying the body's position parameters.</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>


<h2 align = "left"> Game Over Screen </h2>
<p>
Similarly, to create the game over pop-up, we create an animation in the UI to change
the transparency and scaling (size) of the game over screen to create a smooth transition
from gameplay to a static game over. When the player loses all of their health, they go into the
death animation and are unable to move any more.
</p>

<h1 align ="left"> Physical Simulations and Mechanics</h1>

<h2 align ="left">3D Sound System</h2>
<p>
  When an enemy dies, it explodes, and we want to play an "BOOM!" sound to accompany
  our animation. Simply playing the audio clip when the player kills an enemy is unrealistic,
  so we wrote a script to determine where the audio clip is played in 3D space.
  We determined the location via linear interpolation: $$0.9f \cdot \text{Camera.main.transform.position} + 0.1f \cdot \text{transform.position}$$
</p>

<h2 align ="left"> Character Controls</h2>
<p>
  Although this is a shooter game, the player controls are more or less like a car (ie. you can go
  forward and backwards, but "A" and "D" rotate the player model counter-clockwise and clockwise
  about the model's "up axis" respectively). We set the player's velocity to

  $$(\text{forwardInput} \cdot \text{forwardVel}) + \text{falling_velocity}$$

  where forwardInput is a value between -1 and 1, determined by how long the player has held down the
  "W"(positive) or "S" (negative) key, forwardVel is a vector in the world determined by the model's position
  and falling_velocity is determined in the jumping controls.

  For jumping, we use a raycast calculation to determine whether the player is grounded (after all,
  we don't want a flying penguin). We then set falling_velocity to jump_velocity (a vector in the world pointing in the
  "upwards" direction of the player model) if the player is grounded, otherwise we decrement falling_velocity with a
  downward acceleration (gravity).

<h2 align ="left">Shooting Action and Gun Shot Simulation</h2>
<p>
We implemented the shooting interaction using raycasts. Similar to what we've learned in CS 184, we can cast a ray from the camera
to test for line-of-sign intersection with any colliders in front of the crosshair. When the player taps left click,
a ray is generated from the camera-crosshair position within a particular range.
Also, I added point light to all the particles in particle system to simulate gun’s muzzle.
Whenever the play shoots, we create a point light on the muzzle and bullet shells fall to simulate a gunshot.
Additionally, a delay is added to the player's shooting action so that the player is not overpowered.
</p>

<h2 align ="left"> Camera Perspective </h2>
<p>
  We also implement the capability to switch between third and first person view.
  This is done by creating two cameras and assigning the switch of displays to a
  keybind.
</p>

<h2 align =”middle”>Enemy AI</h2>
Our zombies move according to Unity's NavMeshAgent.
We set a lookRadius for each zombie so that it chases the player when entering its aggro zone.
Additionally, the NavMeshAgent then proceeds to chase the player while avoiding obstacles within by a certain distance.
When the enemy is close enough to the player, it plays an attack animation and reduces the player's health.
