<h2 align="middle">Abstract</h2>
<p>
We make a zombie survival shooter game in Unity3d. We demonstrate the use of fractals
in generating explosions for enemy death animations, build a 3D sound perspective system,
and highlight a multitude of physical simulations. We discuss some of the difficulties we faced
during our project development.

<h2 align = "middle">Explosion generation</h2>
<p>
  One of the main graphics component of our project is the explosions that happen when enemies are killed. Instead of using Unity’s particle system, we decided to try using C# scripted fractals to generate our explosion visuals. An explosion is kind of like a ball of fire that first expands then contracts, and I think that using fractals would be an interesting way to create this effect. To get started, I followed a tutorial on how to use recursion to generate basic fractals from the VR@Berkeley website. My script takes in a geometric shape (In our case a sphere), and recursively spawns children (more spheres) in different directions to create a fractal.
</p>
<p>
  The first challenge is to generate a fractal in the shape of a sphere because that’s the shape explosions tend to take. If I just have each fractal (with the exception of the first one at depth 0 which has 6 children) generate a total of five children: above, below, rightward, leftward, and to the front of it, the final result after (depth = 5) recursions is a fractal takes the shape of a regular octahedron, with one vertex pointing in the direction of each axis, which was not what I wanted. In order to create a more spherical result, I took my 5 existing child directions, split them into 4 triangles, and created 4 new directions from interpolating the 3 points of each triangle. This way, each fractal generates 9 children that are spread out more evenly in a hemispheric shape. With the extra children, unity can only process (depth = 4) recursions without lagging, but the tradeoff is worth it because now the script generates a fractal in the form of a sphere. A modification that I made is that at depths 1 and 3, each fractal only makes the original 5 children. This helps reduce lag while letting the result fractal retain its spherical form. The fractal generates a total of 1+(1*6)+(6*9)+(54*5)+(270*9) = 2761 mini objects.
</p>
<p>
  Now that I have a fractal in the shape of a sphere, the next challenge is to give it the colors of an explosion. In an explosion, the center is more yellow while the outer edges are more orange. I first tried creating this effect by making the depth 0 to 3 children yellow and making the depth 4 children orange. The result was a solid yellow cluster of spheres with some specs of orange around it, which looked really ugly so I had to try something different. Instead of applying a texture of solid color to my spheres, I used a transparent texture with a orange tint. This worked unexpectedly well. In the center of the fractal where most of the shapes overlap, the overlapping transparent textures created a really bright yellow color at the center which shifts to orange as you approach the edges where less texture density resulted in less overlap.
</p>
<p>
  I wanted my explosion to expand and contract like a real explosion, so I set different expiration timers for each recursion layer. The first layers exist for 1 second, and each layer lasts shorter and shorter until it hits 0.1 second at depth = 4. Now the explosion expands and contracts smoothly. Thanks to the transparent textures I used, the color effects of having a bright center and orange edges persists even as the outer layers expire and disappear.
</p>
<p>
  Now that the fractal looks decently like an explosion, I started to work on the lighting effects so that the explosion illuminates its surroundings. The light from the explosion should go in all directions, so I chose to work with point light sources and got started by deciding on the color, intensity, and range of the light. After we got those values down, I tested some different approaches to putting the light into the explosion. The first method was to spawn one big point light source at the center of the fractal that starts with the first sphere and lasts the duration of the explosion. It looked okay, but a little boring. It lacked the flickering light effect that explosions tend to have as their forms rapidly change. Then I tried putting a light source on multiple selected children at every depth, which unfortunately was too much for unity to handle. What I settled with was putting a light source at each of the six children at depth = 1. Since there is a tiny instant in time between the creation (and deletion) of each of these six children, the lights together create a flickering effect on its surroundings as the explosion expands and also as the explosion ends.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I scaled the explosion’s size to that of the object exploding and added a burst of smoke using Unity’s particle system. I also added some randomization to children size so that each explosion looks slightly different. With all the coding and special effects completed, I started trying out different base meshes for the fractal other than the sphere. Each mesh I tried resulted in a completely different kind of explosion and I’ll list a few of the most notable ones. Using a curved cylinder mesh turned the explosion into a spiral of flame. Using a tree branch created a flaming sea urchin. Using a very small leaf mesh resulted in thousands of specs of fiery dust. Using a more rectangular mesh gave a sort of pixelated effect like the kind of explosion you would see in a 90’s video game. The wide variety of different fractal explosions that could be generated using the same code was what surprised me the most about this project.

<h2 align = "middle"> Penguin animations </h2>
We created the death animation for our penguin player. We make the penguin model
writhe in place by rotating its body, dictating the parameters in keyframes of the animation.
We then let unity's built-in tweening program interpolate the animations in between the key frames.
After creating the animation, we string together an animation state machine to determine when to transition
from one animation to the other.

<h2 align = "middle"> Game Over Screen </h2>
Similarly, to create the game over pop-up, we create an animation in the UI to change
the transparency and scaling (size) of the game over screen to create a smooth transition
from gameplay to a static game over.

<h1 align ="middle"> Physical Simulations and Mechanics</h1>

<h2 align ="middle">3D Sound System</h2>
<p>
  When an enemy dies, it explodes, and we want to play an "BOOM!" sound to accompany
  our animation. Simply playing the audio clip when the player kills an enemy is unrealistic,
  so we wrote a script to determine where the audio clip is played in 3D space.
  We determined the location via linear interpolation: 0.9f*Camera.main.transform.position + 0.1f*transform.position.

<h2 align ="middle">Shooting and Gun Shots Simulation</h2>
<p>
We implemented shooting calculation using raycast. From CS184, we learned to cast a ray and test the intersection.
We used raycast for the gun. When user presses left click, we shoot a ray toward the position of gun pointing(camera position) with range of 100.
If it hits something, ray cast would return the object it hits.
We used this technique as our base for the shooting method.
Also, I added point light to all the particles in particle system to simulate gun’s muzzle.
Whenever user shoots, it emits a point light on the muzzle to simulate muzzle flash with particle systems like bullets shells.

<h2 align =”middle”>Explosion Simulation</h2>
<p>
We used fractals to generate our explosion effects. So far we’ve completed our main script for creating a fractal using recursion and added it into the game. The generated fractal currently uses a sphere as a base mesh and forms the general shape, color, and lighting effects of an explosion. Next steps include finding a more suitable and realistic base mesh shape as well as adding smoke effects with the help of the particle system.

<h2 align =”middle”>Character Controller</h2>
<p>
I wrote my own character controller on the penguin. I calculate different velocity in 3D space based on player’s button like “W A S D”. I also bind left click on mouse to shoot action.
</p>

<h2 align =”middle”>3D Sound Effect</h2>
<p>
I made an audio listener and put it on main character penguin. For each zombie, I made an audio source with range of 10 and the curve is linear rolloff to create variation of volume. When our main character is close to the zombie, the volume of zombie sound increases. For explosion sound effect, I used the linear combination of camera position and exploded object using formula: 0.9f*Camera.main.transform.position + 0.1f*transform.position. At this position I created an explosion sound effect instance that lasts even as the zombie object gets destroyed.
</p>

<h2 align =”middle”>Enemy AI</h2>
We use Unity3d’s NavMeshAgent for our zombie AI. We set a lookRadius for each zombie so that it chases the player when entering its aggro zone. The NavMeshAgent then proceeds to chase the player while avoiding obstacles within by a certain distance.
